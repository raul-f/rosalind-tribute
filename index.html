            Born in 1920 in London, Rosalind Elsie Franklin wanted to be a
            scientist ever since she was a teenager. Despite being discouraged
            by her father (it wasn't an easy career for women at the time), she
            won a scholarship to study chemistry at Cambridge University, where
            she graduated and received her chemistry Ph.D. in 1945. In 1947,
            after doing some research on coal structure, she went to the
            Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'Ã‰tat in Paris, where
            she became a specialist in X-Ray chrystallography. After being
            granted a fellowship at King's College in 1951, she moved to London
            determined to study the structure of DNA with her newly-acquired
            expertise.

            There, she was set to share her workspace with Maurice Wilkins, who
            initially thought she had been hired to be his lab assistant; a bad
            beggining to a relationship that never got better. Nevertheless, she
            upgraded the X-ray lab and got to work on her new subject.
            Unbeknownst to her, american biologist James Watson and British
            physicist Francis Crick were working on the same subject as her, but
            found themselves unable to make any progress. In 1952, she finally
            obtained a picture that contained relevant information, which she
            called Photo 51, took 100 hours to produce and would take much more
            time to analyze. In the meantime, Wilkins, who was an acquaintance
            of Watson and Crick, showed her picture to them, without her
            knowledge or consent. The moment they saw it, they became ecstatic -
            they knew it was something big. In their lab, they sketched some
            quick models that would fit the photo's data, eventually arriving at
            the right one. They got their big result in 1953 and submitted it to
            Nature, the same year that Rosalind finished her analysis, got to
            the same conclusion and submitted it. Both articles were published
            in the same issue, but Rosalind's was put last, making it look like
            her experiments confirmed Watson and Crick's breakthrough, instead
            of inspiring it.

            At this point, Franklin had already stopped working on DNA, going on
            to study the structure of viruses. In 1956, on a business trip to
            the US, she found a lump in her abdomen which turned out to be
            ovarian cancer. She died of it less than two years later, at just 37
            years of age. In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilikins were awarded the
            Nobel Prize for their work on the structure of DNA. It's widely
            believed she would have been awarded too, if only she were alive at
            the time. In fact, some even think she could have won a second
            Nobel, as her work on the structure of viruses led to a colleague
            winning the prize in 1982.

            The world certainly deserved more than 37 years of Rosalind
            Franklin.
          </p>
          <h2>Here's a timeline of her life:</h2>

              at King's College, London, to research the structure of
              deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); discovered that DNA can take two
              forms, "A" and "B"; produced diffraction photo of B form of DNA
              that led to Watson and Crick's theory of its double-helix
              structure.

              <strong>1953:</strong>James Watson and Francis Crick announced
              their discovery of DNA structure in Nature on April 25, 1953.
              Franklin and Raymond Gosling published their x-ray findings in
              same issue; however, as their article was arranged to come after
              Watson and Crick's, it seemed as it had confirmed their result,
              not inspired it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1953-58:</strong>At invitation of J. D. Bernal, directed

              its RNA.

              research labs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fall 1956:</strong>Diagnosed with ovarian cancer.</li>
            <li><strong>1958:</strong>Died in London on April 16th.</li>
